# âœ¨ Future Spaces â€“ A Collaborative Vision

For this project, each of us created a personal **future space** â€” a place that reflects where we see ourselves in the future. Whether itâ€™s five years from now, after graduation, or once weâ€™ve found our dream lifestyle or career, these spaces are intimate portraits of who we hope to become.

Each space is unique and deeply personal. Some are symbolic, others realistic â€” but they all revolve around a shared theme: **our future selves**.

## ðŸ”— Shared Elements: Connection Across Worlds

To create a sense of connection between our individual spaces, we included two shared elements:

### ðŸ”¹ A Door or Portal  
In each space, youâ€™ll find a shared transition point â€” for most of us, itâ€™s a door; for some, a portal.  
While they may look different, they all serve the same purpose:  
They represent **opportunity, change, and becoming**.

When visitors walk through them, theyâ€™re not just moving between environments â€” theyâ€™re stepping into someone elseâ€™s personal vision of the future.  
Itâ€™s a symbolic passage from one imagined reality to another.


### ðŸ”¹ A Poster Showing the Year  
Each space includes a poster displaying a future year. This small detail provides **context** and invites **reflection**:

> *Where do I want to be by then?*

It grounds the imagination in time, connecting dreams with intention.

## ðŸ§µ A Red Thread Through All Worlds

These two elements â€” **the door** and **the year** â€” form a red thread through all of our worlds.  
They remind us that even though our futures may look different, we are all exploring the same themes:  
**change, growth, and identity.**
